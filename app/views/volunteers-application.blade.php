		<p>Hello friend... You've hopefully made it to this form because you're indicating that you're keen to be part of our volunteers team at EC14 - and this makes us happy. Yay!</p>
		<p>We need you to fill out this form with the following information and then we'll make contact with you once we've received it (please be aware there can be a 7 working day turn around - we're busy with other stuff too, like ordering pies).</p>

		<p>If you haven't heard from us after 7 days, please send us an email at <a href="mailto:volunteers@eastercamp.org.nz">volunteers@eastercamp.org.nz</a> and we'll follow up your request.</p>

		<p><strong>Please note:</strong> we cannot guarantee there'll be spaces on your preferred team, but we'll do our best to make it happen. This is an application form, a place on our team is not guaranteed. </p>

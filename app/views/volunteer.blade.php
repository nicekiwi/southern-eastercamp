		<h1>Volunteer to Help</h1>

		<p>Eastercamp happens only because of a huge army of volunteers. Are you too old to come as a camper? Want to help out? Have a useful trade or skill?</p>
		<p><strong>BE PART OF THE MOVEMENT - SIGN UP NOW!</strong></p>
		<p><strong>Do you have what it takes?</strong></p>
		<p>Volunteers MUST have a great work ethic, be able to handle responsibility, ooze initiative, be willing to serve in multiple areas and are chosen at the discretion of Camp Management who reserve the right to do cross-check references on your character, skill &amp; suitability. Due to regulations, we are required to police vet all of our volunteers.</p>
		<p><strong>What do you get out of it?</strong></p>
		<p>The privilege to serve. And you'll prob lose a few kg carrying stuff too. #winning.</p>

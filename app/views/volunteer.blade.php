		<h1>Volunteer to Help</h1>

		<h3>Do you have what it takes?</h3>

		<p>Volunteers MUST have a great work ethic, be able to handle responsibility, ooze initiative, be willing to serve in multiple areas and are chosen at the discretion of Camp Management who reserve the right to do cross-check references on your character, skill &amp; suitability.
